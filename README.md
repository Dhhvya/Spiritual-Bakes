Its a online food ordering MERN full stack development project for our dessert selling pushcart

Spiritual Bakes is a full-stack online food ordering system designed specifically for bakery
services, developed using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
The platform aims to simplify food ordering and business management for both customers and
bakery owners through a responsive web application and a mobile version built using React
Native.
Key features of the system include secure user authentication, categorized food item
browsing, dynamic cart management, and Stripe-based online payment. Once an order is
placed, customers can track their order status through defined stages such as Food Processing,
Out for Delivery, and Delivered, enhancing transparency and user satisfaction.
On the administrative side, a dedicated Admin Panel allows bakery owners to manage
products, monitor customer orders, and update delivery statuses efficiently. All application
data, including user accounts, orders, and product information, is securely stored and managed
using MongoDB Atlas.
With a clean UI, mobile responsiveness, real-time tracking features, and secure payments,
Spiritual Bakes provides a complete digital solution for modern bakery operations, bridging
the gap between traditional service and digital convenience.
